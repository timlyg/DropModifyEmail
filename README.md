# DropModifyEmail
Drop a file on this script, file gets modified (removing all occurrences of "defang_" in this case), email as attachment

# History
So we have these incoming emails that get "defanged" by the mail filter system (e.g. ForcePoint/Websense), whenever javascript is detected in the attachment.
The good news is, these attachments are generated by Cisco and it provides alternative means of accessing the attached securedoc html page: Email the same securedoc.html attachment to mobile@res.cisco.com and an online link will be generated and sent back by Cisco automatically.
The only problem is, if the attachment has been "defanged", Cisco will not generate such link.
The good news is, "defanged" meant exactly that, the original content still exists, the mail filter simply added the text "defang_" to some tags in the html attachment.
So instead of manually replace the words "defang_" with "", this VBS script is created.
One simply drag and drop the HTML attachment onto this script in Windows Explorer and it will do the rest, including getting the email with the attached modified HTML file ready. Click send and Cisco will do the rest.

# Application
This explores the advantage and simplicity of VBS. A source of reference for file editing or simple email creation with attachments using VBS.
